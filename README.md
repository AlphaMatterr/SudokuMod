<h4>TODO:</h4>

- add compatibility with other devices (MEDIUM)
- add landscape AND portrait compatibility (MEDIUM)
- fix bugs

<h4>BUGS:</h4>

1. All user-added buttons cause a crash at the start of the game. To prevent this, select a random cell, then add a note and a number
2. Undo database acts wonky sometimes when using the extra buttons...
3. Reduction option is blind to conflicts -> it'll reduce a box even if the number is conflicted
